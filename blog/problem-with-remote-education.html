         <p>Faced with an unanticipated lockdown, the only tool many schools could use readily was something like Zoom, which turned out to be woefully insecure even though it was impressively easy to use. Another issue with Zoom is that it was never designed to be an education solution, it merely allows one person to talk remotely with many others.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>That undoubtedly is part of the problem. To keep kids focused and interested in remote lessons, it's critical to have tools that go beyond ordinary communications to help teachers ensure better student attention and performance.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The problems with remote schooling are similar to those associated with working from home, with a few exceptions. Students usually aren't as mature, and most lack the attention span of an adult. They don't have their careers to or income to worry about, so they tend to be less focused, in general, on accomplishing their tasks.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>With a solution like Zoom, which is just a communications tool, it's likely that the lessons won't work, because the students aren't engaged. The level of acting out in the classroom will make it virtually impossible to hold class, let alone instill any knowledge.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Tech firms invest in schools, but they typically don't craft fixated educational tools. Generally, they sell PCs that are priced lower for the market but are specified by the school itself, and there isn't much engagement beyond that.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Lack of engagement makes it difficult for those companies to offer effective help when a school has to pivot to remote operations because their answers typically will be to buy new Windows PCs, Chromebooks, or iPads. While these apparatuses are dire to remote education, they fall well short of what an elucidation should be.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Lack of engagement speaks to why so many schools, after trying to operate remotely, gave up. Their programs weren't working.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Lack of engagement likely impacted sales to the education market as well. Lenovo came up with the idea of buying a company (LanSchool), created by teachers for teachers, and selling its product to schools to increase engagement. Lenovo realized that while technology was becoming more prevalent in schools, the OEMs weren't advancing as quickly in understanding the changes affecting education and weren't positioning effectively.</p>
